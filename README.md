# Nigeria-Nema---2022--flood-dashboard
Data-driven analysis of the 2022 NEMA flood dataset, featuring interactive PowerBI dashboards, trend analysis, and geospatial visualization of flood impact and displacement across Nigeria.

NEMA 2022 Flood Impact Analysis – Nigeria
This project presents a data-driven analysis of the 2022 NEMA Flood Dataset, designed to transform complex disaster data into clear, actionable insights for decision-making, policy planning, and humanitarian response.
Using structured data analysis, interactive visualization, and geospatial mapping, I analyzed patterns of flood impact across Nigeria to identify trends, hotspots, and areas of greatest vulnerability. The dashboard provides a KPI-driven national overview, temporal trends of affected vs. displaced populations, spatial distribution of displacement risk, and a granular breakdown by State, LGA, and Community.
Key findings include nearly 1.6million people affected, over 867,000 displaced, and a 55.1% displacement rate, with Anambra State emerging as the most impacted.
